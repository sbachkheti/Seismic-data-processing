# Seismic-data-processing
The objective of this work is to illustrate how a seismic waveform changes through different stages of processing of the data. For this purpose, I have written software for: 
A: Generation of multi-offset synthetic data (with and without noise)for a model of ‘n’ flat layers by using ray tracing. (REF: Hron & May, “Methods inComputational Physics, Vol 12”).
B: Extraction of wavelet from a trace assuming Minimum Phase assumption.Ihave extractedseismic wavelet from synthetic data from different offset traces and examinedthe variation in the extracted waveformand analyzedthe effect of directivity, angle dependence of reflection coefficients and noise. By extracting wavelet from synthetics generated with different number of layers and thicknesses of the layers, I have shown the effect of tuning on seismic waveform. 
Another important objective was to see how extracted waveform depends on the signal-to-noise ratio of the input data and on NMO stretched data and the same has been carried out.
